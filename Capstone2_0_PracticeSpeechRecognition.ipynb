Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, “I don’t know.” He wouldn’t say “Yes” and he wouldn’t say “No” either. He could never learn to make a choice. His Aunt Helen said to him “No-one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind than a blade of grass.” Arthur looked wise but said nothing. One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft where they lived. The pine rafters were all rotten, and at last one of the joists had given way and fallen to the ground. The walls shook and the rats’ hair stood on end with fear and horror. “This won’t do,” said the old rat who was chief, “I’ll send out scouts to search for a new home.” Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, “We’ve found a stone house which is just what we wanted. There’s room and good food for us all. There’s a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf and a garden with an elm tree.” Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. “Are you coming with us?” he asked. “I don’t know,” Arthur sighed, “The roof may not come down just yet.” “Well,” said the old rat angrily, “We can’t wait all day for you to make up your mind. Right about face! March!” And they went off. Arthur stood and watched the other rats hurry away. The idea of an immediate decision was too much for him. “I’ll go back to my hole for a bit,” he said to himself, “just to make up my mind.” That night there was a great crash that shook the earth, and down came the whole roof. Next day some men rode up and looked at the ruins. One of them moved a board, and under it they saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole. \"\"\"\n",

Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, \"I don't know.\" He wouldn't say \"yes\" or \"no\" either. He would always shirk making a choice. His aunt Helen said to him, \"Now look here. No one is going to care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind than a blade of grass.\" One rainy day, the rats heard a great noise in the loft. The pine rafters were all rotten, so that the barn was rather unsafe. At last the joists gave way and fell to the ground. The walls shook and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror. \"This won't do,\" said the captain. \"I'll send out scouts to search for a new home.\" Within five hours the ten scouts came back and said, \"We found a stone house where there is room and board for us all. There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf, and a garden with an elm tree.\" The rats crawled out of their little houses and stood on the floor in a long line. Just then the old one saw Arthur. \"Stop,\" he ordered coarsely. \"You are coming, of course?\" \"I'm not certain,\" said Arthur, undaunted. \"The roof may not come down yet.\" \"Well,\" said the angry old rat, \"we can't wait for you to join us. Right about face. March!\" Arthur stood and watched them hurry away. \"I think I'll go tomorrow,\" he calmly said to himself, but then again \"I don't know; it's so nice and snug here.\" That night there was a big crash. In the foggy morning some men—with some boys and girls—rode up and looked at the barn. One of them moved a board and he saw a young rat, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole. Thus the shirker got his due. \"\"\"\n",
