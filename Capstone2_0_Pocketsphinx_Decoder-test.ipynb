    "\"*Once there was a young rat named Arthur, who could never make up his mind. Whenever his friends asked him if he would like to go out with them, he would only answer, \"I don't know.\" He wouldn't say \"yes\" or \"no\" either. He could never learn to make a choice. His aunt Helen said to him, \"No one is going to care for you if you carry on like this.\" One rainy day, the rats heard a great noise in the loft where the pine rafters were all rotten. At last the joints gave way and fell to the ground. The walls shook and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror. \"This won't do,\" said the captain. \"I'll send scouts out to search for a new home.\" Three hours later the seven scouts came back and said, \"We have found just what we wanted, a stone house where there is room and good food for us all. There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf, and a garden with an elm tree.\" Just then the old rat saw Arthur. \"Stop,\" he ordered coarsely. \"Are you coming?\" \"Of course I suppose I ought,\" Arthur sighed, \"but the roof may not come down yet.\" \"Well,\" said the angry old rat, \"we can't wait all day for you. Right about face. March!\" And they went off. Arthur stood and watched them hurry away. The idea of immediate decision was too much for him.  \"Why do they have to go today?\" he said calmly to himself.  That night there was a great crash that shook the earth. In the foggy morning some men rode up and looked at the ruins. One of them moved a board and saw a young rat lying on his side, quite dead, half in and half out of his hole. \n",
